# ACL-Robots
ACL (Advanced Control Language) is programmed into a set of EPROMs within Controller-A, and can be accessed from any standard terminal or PC computer by means of an RS232 communication channel.

These codes present the basic syntax for use within the RoboSoft program, being able to command robot stations.
